        <h3>Description</h3>
        A riveting challenge where Geowizard attempts to cross a (relatively 
        small) country in a completely straight line. He measures his success 
        with his completely made up and pointless grading system.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An incredibly detailed line which includes mountains, rivers
                and lots of potentially angry farmers.
            </li>
            <li>Distinct lack of vital equipment such as gloves and a satellite
                phone.
            </li>
            <li>An incredibly loyal girlfriend (soon to be wife) that will drive
                around the middle of nowhere to keep you stocked up with supplies.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set off optimistically, rambling away to any poor elderly couple
                you pass about your straight line mission while they try to have
                a nice, quiet countryside walk.
            </li>
            <li>Update your viewers of your constant fear of the local farmers,
                as they could kick you off their land bringing an end
                to the mission.
            </li>
            <li>Proclaim that you have reached a low point of the mission, as
                your body and mind become tired due to exhaustion.
            </li>
            <li>Make a overly risky maneuvre that could result in death, as perfectly
                demonstrated by Geowizard below, where he tries to wade through
                a Norweigan peat bog.
            </li>
            <li>Either give up or finally reach your destination, which is a rather
                underwhelming inland estuary and not an extensive beach as one would
                imagine a coast to be.
            </li>
            <li>Make a 30+ minute video explaining how close you followed the line
                and give it a ranking on the completely made up and pointless 
                ranking system.
            </li>
        </ol>
